# Study of recommender systems
Some of the assignments completed as a part of "Recommender systems" module of [HardML](https://karpov.courses/ml-hard) course by [karpov.courses](https://karpov.courses/).

## Content

* metrics -- the implementation of the most commonly used metrics in the construction of recommender systems;
* action_sequence -- the task goal is to improve the algorithm that will determine the most relevant recommendations for each user based on their listening history. The solution is based on predicting the next actions of users based on the sequence of their interactions in the past.
* ranking -- creating a recommender system for ad recommendations on a marketplace. The task is to improve the algorithm that will determine the most relevant recommendations for each user based on user and product attributes, as well as the history of interactions between them. The goal is to increase the NDSG score, the most common metric for ranking systems.
